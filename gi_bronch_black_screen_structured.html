   Troubleshooting Steps
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Check keyboard indicators – ensure at least one LED light is illuminated. If there is a light, there is power to the system and probably the computer is operational If there is no light on the keyboard - Listen for internal fans – no fan sound means computer is not turned ON.
   </li>
   <li>
    Inspect main power switch at the back of the simulator – confirm the switch is on and illuminated. If it illuminated, Try to turn the computer ON by pressing red button on the front, above scope connector.
   </li>
   <li>
    If the main switch is ON but not illuminated, Verify power connection – check if  power cord is fully inserted and test wall outlet with another device.
   </li>
   <li>
    If there is power, fans spinning and keyboard light is ON - Check monitor connections – ensure power, video, and USB cables are fully inserted.
   </li>
   <li>
    Test monitor power – toggle monitor ON/OFF either by power button or by removing and reinserting power cable at the back of the monitor. If short message appears, like ‘No video signal’ , monitor is working. You can test  with another computer or laptop to confirm functionality. If monitor has power and all cables connected and still no picture, it could be computer failure. In that case a customer support specialist needs to be involved.
